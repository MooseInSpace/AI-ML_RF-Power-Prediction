# AI-ML_RF-Power-Prediction
AI/ML learning project to familiarize with Python Data Analytics/Visualization libraries. Currently utilizing Artificially Generated Data with the future idea of incorporating real data using SDR technologies.

This Repo is meant to be a means of version control for myself, as I am constantly altering and modifying these scripts. This is entirely a work in progress with a learn as I go mentality as it covers topics I am deeply interested in.
The SATCOM - User Input.py script is for loading the trained model from the training script, and applying the model to an Input Power and attenuation that the User provides then receiving an Output Power based on Inference from the model.
Since there are tons of working copies for these scripts utilizing different approach methods, the two uploaded scripts may not actually work off of one another as intended and there's likely to be errors and/or inconcistencies. However, I believe the general concept of the code gets the point/idea across!
